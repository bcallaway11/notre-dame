## Minimum Wage Data

This is the main data used during the workshop.

* **Full Data:** [mw_data_ch2.RData](mw_data_ch2.RData) &nbsp; [mw_data_ch2.dta](mw_data_ch2.dta)

* **Main subset of data used in workshop** [data2.RData](data2.RData) &nbsp; [data2.dta](data2.dta)

* **Alternative subset of data mentioned in workshop** [data3.RData](data3.RData) &nbsp; [data3.dta](data3.dta)

* **Data with more years used for IFE** [mw_data_ch_more_years2.RData](mw_data_ch_more_years2.RData)

## Additional Materials

A main resource for the material from today's workshop is my DID chapter in the *Handbook of Labor, Human Resources, and Population Economics*.  The published (gated) version is available [here](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_352-1).   The (ungated) draft version is available [here](https://bcallaway11.github.io/files/Callaway-Chapter-2022/main.pdf).

<!--The material for today's lecture is a subset of the material that I taught at LSU in the Spring of 2024.  The full set of materials for that course are available [here](https://github.com/bcallaway11/lsu-workshop). -->
