## Additional Materials

A main resource for the material from today's workshop is my DID chapter in the *Handbook of Labor, Human Resources, and Population Economics*.  The published (gated) version is available [here](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_352-1).   The (ungated) draft version is available [here](https://bcallaway11.github.io/files/Callaway-Chapter-2022/main.pdf).

The material for today's workshop is a subset of the material that I taught at the Bank of Portugal earlier in Fall 2024.  If you are interested, the full set of materials for that course are available [here](https://github.com/bcallaway11/bank-of-portugal).
